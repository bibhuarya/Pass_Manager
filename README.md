# Pass_Manager
A personal password manager for everyone based on AES and SHA3_256 Algorithms. Its a light and robust password manager build using python and works well with windows.

The python pyinstaller package was used to convert an executable file for windows user.
Its completely safe to use this password manager as it is based on SHA3_256 bit encryption and also the file which stores you password is locally stored (Euler.enc).
